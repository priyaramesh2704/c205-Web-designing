Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the
presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML
(including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of
the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. <br><br>
CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including
layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, since the
content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and
control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to
share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to
improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting. <br><br>
Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same
markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print,
by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.
CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
<br><br>
The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which
declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property match a particular element.
This cascading priority scheme is predictable. <br><br>
The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March
1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents. <br><br>
n addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML,
plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit. <br><br>
